## Abstract
In this project, we analyse the performance of two well-known sort-
ing algorithms, Insertion Sort and Merge Sort. We benchmark the
performance of the different algorithms in the worst, average and
best case. We compare the results from the benchmark to the theo-
retical performance of each algorithm for the three different cases:
the worst, the average, the best.

## Conclution
We find that the run time of our experiments coincides with the
expected theoretical results regarding both Insertion and Merge
sort.
